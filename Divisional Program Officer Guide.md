After setting up Google Colab with the Conference Planner code, you will need a directory on your Google Drive to work with the abstracts for your division. This directory should be shared with you from the Program Officer.

- You need to have edit permissions to your division folder (please do not rename this folder). 
The folder for your division should have the following files: 
    - **talks.csv** : Simplified listing of the abstract and title on contributed talks
    - **posters.csv** : Similar listing for contributed posters
    - **talks_ratings.csv**: Values for the keyword ratings for talks.
    - **posters_ratings.csv**: Keyword ratings for the posters.
    - **abstracts_revised.csv**: Copy of all abstracts for the meeting.

- Launch [session_planner.ipynb](session_planner.ipynb) from the conference_planner folder in the "Colab Notebooks" folder on Drive. Follow the instructions in that notebook.
